    <strong><font size="6">Journey to Cracking the Interview of JetBlue Airlines.</font></strong>
</p>
<p style="font size=4vw;">
    Ravi belonged to a small town from India and he came to Arizona State
    University for his undergraduate in Computer Science. He had just completed
    his sophomore year and was given an opportunity to interview at a company
    called JetBlue airlines. He was interviewed for a position of Data Analyst
    intern at JetBlue. For his internship he had a couple of interview rounds
    in which the first round was to give a small comparison to the hiring
    manager with respect to JetBlue and its nearest market competitor using
    which was freely available for him to compile and give
    Tableau. So he arranged the dataset from the bureau of transportation statistics (BTS)
    the recruiters a comparison between JetBlue and their nearest competitor.
    He had recently taken a Data Visualization course and had learnt the basic
    concepts of Tableau. He explored the datasets on Kaggle but could not find
    an appropriate one for sending it to the hiring manager. He found the alternate link for the dataset
    <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236">
        here
    </a>
    . He started the exploratory process with one of the most common question.

</p>
<p style="font size=4vw;">
    <strong>
        Q1. Which all destinations do JetBlue fly across the United States?
    </strong>

</p>
<p style="font size=4vw;" >
    A1. He created this geographical chart showing multiple cities and states
    which showed the destinations and the origins covered by JetBlue airlines
    across the United States.
    Next, On exploring the source and destination he wanted to dig in the
    dataset and find more about the operating days and number of airlines for a
    particular week.
</p>
<p>
    <font size="4">
    His next exploratory task was to determine the number of operating flights
    on each day of the Week.

</p>
<p>
    <strong><font size="4">
        Q2. How many flights did JetBlue had on each day of the Week in an
        entire financial year?
    </font></strong>

    </strong>
</p>
<p style="font size=4vw;" >
    On plotting the curve for the number of flights JetBlue had each day.Ravi
    realized that the number of flights were highest on Fridays and in general
    Saturday had the least number of flights.

</p>
<p style="font size=4vw;" >
    <strong>
        Q3. Identifying the nearest competitor and comparing its industrial
        share with others.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A3. On exploring the dataset, he found that the nearest competitor of
    JetBlue was ExpressJet in terms of revenue and market share. He again drew
    the chart and realized that the total number of flights that ExpressJet had
    was around 400k and JetBlue had 300k. The origins served by ExpressJet was
    more than of JetBlue. JetBlue had 68 destinations across US whereas
    ExpressJet had 180 airports.

<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>
    To summarize Ravi created an analysis of Jetblue airlines using the BTS Dataset and
    submitted the document which the company requested for his first round of interview. He found more about
    the destinations as well as the source of JetBlue Airlines. He also found weekly frequency of the airlines and concluded
    that the least number of airlines are on Saturday. Apart from that he also found out that their nearest competitor in terms
    of number of flights are ExpressJet airlines.
